# Large-Language-Model

xLLM: New Generation of Large Language Models

# Mixture of experts
One specialized, small sub-LLM per top category
LLM router (multi-agent system) to manage the sub-LLMs
User selects top category and hyperparameters
Each sub-LLM built with its own taxonomy and knowledge graph

# No neural network, no training
Thus, low cost, easy to fine-tune (in milliseconds per sub-LLM)
Self-tuned based on favorite hyperparameters, and customizable
No GPU, no latency, better results, local implementation
