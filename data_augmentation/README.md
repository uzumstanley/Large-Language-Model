This folder contains additional input sources to augment the Wolfram crawl in xLLM5. For details, see project 7.2.3 in the project textbook available <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Projects4.pdf">here</a>. In addition to the textbook itself in PDF format, you can now leverage the LaTeX sources used to produce the PDF. I added all my books, not just the project textbook. These LaTeX sources might be easier to parse than PDF docs, to reconstruct the taxonomy (using the table of contents), retrieve tables, images, index and glossary keywords, and so on.  

In the future, the plan is to have a markdown version of the book, browsable like a website.
